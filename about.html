                <h1 id="about-overview">About Project Zion</h1>
                
                <p>Project Zion addresses a critical gap in cybersecurity support. Too many victims of digital crimes face a difficult choice: suffer in silence or navigate complex reporting systems that often feel as invasive as the original violation. We created this platform to provide immediate, anonymous assistance without compromising anyone's privacy or safety.</p>

                <h2 id="why-zion">Why "Zion"?</h2>
                <p>The name "Zion" reflects our core mission: providing sanctuary and safety in the digital realm. Traditionally, Zion represents a place of refuge and security‚Äîexactly what we aim to offer to victims of digital crimes.</p>
                
                <p>The name also draws inspiration from the Matrix trilogy, where Zion serves as humanity's last safe haven from digital manipulation and control. Like that fictional sanctuary, Project Zion represents a space where people can seek help without fear of surveillance, data harvesting, or further digital exploitation.</p>

                <h2 id="origin-story">Our Origin Story</h2>
                <p>Project Zion was developed during the TENET'25 Hackathon in response to a significant problem we observed in cybersecurity victim support. Current reporting mechanisms typically require extensive personal information, lengthy procedures, and can feel intimidating to people who are already dealing with digital trauma.</p>
                
                <p>Through our research, we found that many victims simply give up when trying to get help. The process of seeking assistance often feels nearly as violating as the original incident, leading people to handle serious security threats alone rather than risk further exposure.</p>

                <div class="emphasis-block">
                    <h3 id="team-motivation">Our Team's Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Our team combines expertise in cybersecurity, user experience design, and digital privacy advocacy. We've each witnessed how digital crimes affect real people‚Äîfrom family members falling victim to sophisticated scams to friends dealing with identity theft and online harassment. This isn't just a technical problem for us; it's a human one that deserves a thoughtful, compassionate solution.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Project Zion serves as a secure, anonymous resource for victims of cybercrime, digital harassment, and privacy violations. Our platform enables users to:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Access immediate support</strong> without creating accounts or providing personal information</li>
                    <li><strong>Receive expert guidance</strong> on cybersecurity, digital safety, and privacy protection</li>
                    <li><strong>Get emotional support</strong> during what can be an isolating and stressful experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand available options</strong> for reporting, recovery, and prevention</li>
                    <li><strong>Connect with relevant resources</strong> and specialized organizations when needed</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="our-approach">How We Actually Do This</h2>
                <p>Our approach is pretty straightforward:</p>
                
                <div class="resource-category">
                    <h3 id="privacy-first">üîí Your Privacy Comes First</h3>
                    <p>We don't collect anything. No emails, no phone numbers, no tracking. You're completely anonymous.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="resource-category">
                    <h3 id="real-support">ü§ù Real Support, Not Scripts</h3>
                    <p>Our AI, powered by Cohere's advanced language models, isn't going to give you generic "have you tried turning it off and on again" responses. It's trained to actually understand cybersecurity issues and respond like a knowledgeable friend would.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="resource-category">
                    <h3 id="practical-steps">üéØ Practical Steps You Can Take</h3>
                    <p>We focus on giving you clear, actionable advice that you can actually implement, not theoretical cybersecurity lectures.</p>
                </div>

                <h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>
                <p>Look, we know this started as a hackathon project, but we're not planning to just abandon it after the competition ends. There's clearly a real need for something like this, and we want to keep improving it.</p>
                
                <p>Every conversation that happens here teaches us something new about what people are actually dealing with online. We want to use those insights to make the platform better, partner with people who know more than we do, and maybe actually make a dent in this problem.</p>

                <div class="emphasis-block">
                    <h3 id="want-to-help">Want to Help?</h3>
                    <p>If you work in cybersecurity, mental health, law, or you just think this kind of thing matters, we'd love to hear from you. We're not trying to solve everything ourselves‚Äîwe know we need help from people with more experience and different perspectives.</p>
