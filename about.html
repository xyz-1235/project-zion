                <h1>About Project Zion</h1>
                
                <p>Project Zion was born from a shared vision of creating a safer digital world for everyone. In an era where cybercrime is becoming increasingly sophisticated and victims often feel helpless and alone, we recognized the urgent need for a supportive, anonymous platform where people could seek help without fear of judgment or further exposure.</p>

                <h2>Our Origin Story</h2>
                <p>Project Zion emerged during the TENET'25 Hackathon, where our diverse team came together with a common goal: to combat the growing threat of digital crime and cyberbullying. As we researched the landscape of cybersecurity support, we discovered a troubling gap in accessible, anonymous assistance for victims of digital crimes.</p>
                
                <p>Traditional reporting mechanisms often require extensive personal information, lengthy procedures, and can be intimidating for victims who are already traumatized. Many people suffer in silence, unsure of where to turn or afraid that seeking help might make their situation worse.</p>

                <div class="emphasis-block">
                    <h3>The Team's Motivation</h3>
                    <p>Our diverse team brings together expertise in cybersecurity, mental health advocacy, user experience design, and social justice. We've all witnessed firsthand how digital crimes can devastate lives, and we're committed to ensuring that no one has to face these challenges alone.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Project Zion serves as a digital sanctuary‚Äîa safe haven where victims of cybercrime, digital harassment, scams, and privacy violations can:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Seek immediate, anonymous guidance</strong> without revealing their identity</li>
                    <li><strong>Access expert knowledge</strong> about cybersecurity, privacy protection, and digital safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Receive emotional support</strong> during what may be the most vulnerable time in their digital lives</li>
                    <li><strong>Learn about their options</strong> for reporting, recovery, and prevention</li>
                    <li><strong>Connect with resources</strong> that can provide ongoing assistance</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Why "Zion"?</h2>
                <p>The name "Zion" carries deep symbolic meaning from multiple sources. In many cultures and traditions, Zion represents sanctuary, refuge, and hope‚Äîexactly what we aim to provide in the digital realm. The name also draws inspiration from the Matrix trilogy, where Zion serves as the last human city, a fortress of safety in a world dominated by digital threats.</p>
                
                <p>Like the Zion of the Matrix‚Äîa secure haven where humans could be free from digital manipulation and control‚ÄîProject Zion represents a safe space where people can seek help without fear of further digital exploitation. Just as physical sanctuaries offer shelter from storms, Project Zion offers shelter from the digital storms that threaten our privacy, security, and peace of mind.</p>

                <h2>Our Approach</h2>
                <p>We believe that effective support requires three fundamental elements:</p>
