# Project Zion

> An anonymous, AI-powered sanctuary for victims of cybercrime.

This project was developed in under 24 hours for the **TENET'25 Hackathon**. Our interpretation of the hackathon's theme, **"The Matrix,"** was to build a project that embodies its core concepts: creating a safe haven (Zion) and empowering users to "wake up" from the confusion of a digital attack.

## üéØ The Core Problem

In the digital age, threats like cyberbullying, phishing scams, and online harassment are rampant. When a person becomes a victim, the technical violation is often compounded by a profound sense of:

* **Isolation:** Victims often feel completely alone, believing no one can understand or help.
* **Fear:** The anonymity of the attacker and the fear of judgment or retaliation prevents them from seeking help from friends, family, or authorities.
* **Confusion:** The immediate aftermath of a digital attack is chaotic. Victims are often unsure of what critical steps to take to protect themselves, their data, and their finances.

Project Zion was built to be the first line of defense against this digital silence.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: Project Zion

Project Zion is a secure, anonymous web platform that provides immediate, 24/7 support. It is a **sanctuary for resistance**, a place where users are not only comforted but also armed with the knowledge to fight back.

The heart of the platform is **Zion**, an empathetic AI companion powered by the Google Gemini API. Zion's dual purpose is to:

1.  **Provide Empathetic Support:** For emotional distress from issues like cyberbullying, Zion is a non-judgmental, always-available listener trained to provide comforting and constructive conversation.
2.  **Deliver Actionable Intelligence:** For technical and financial threats like scams or phishing, Zion functions like The Oracle, providing clear, step-by-step instructions to help users secure their accounts, report the crime, and mitigate the damage.

## üèõÔ∏è System Architecture

Our architecture is designed to be secure, scalable, and modern.

1.  **Front-End:** A static user interface built with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, ensuring a clean, responsive, and accessible experience.
2.  **Backend:** We've adopted a modern, **serverless** approach. A simple function acts as a secure API proxy. Its sole job is to protect our API keys and manage communication with the AI model.
3.  **Core AI:** We leverage the power of the **Google Gemini API** to handle the complex conversational and analytical tasks, allowing us to focus on the user experience.

This API-first strategy enabled us, as a student team, to implement an enterprise-grade AI solution within the tight constraints of a hackathon.
