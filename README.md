> An anonymous, AI-powered sanctuary for victims of cybercrime.

**Project Zion** was developed for the **TENET'25 Hackathon** ("The Matrix" theme). It is a web-based, secure safe haven designed to provide immediate and empathetic support to individuals facing cyberbullying, online scams, and other forms of digital distress.

## 🛡️ Why "Zion"? 

In the world of *The Matrix*, Zion is the last human city—a hidden, underground sanctuary where humanity is safe from a hostile, machine-controlled world. Our project draws a direct parallel to this: **Project Zion aims to be a digital sanctuary**, a secure and anonymous safe haven for individuals facing the hostile and often overwhelming threats of the online world.

We chose the name Zion because it represents more than just a place of passive safety; it represents a place of **resistance and empowerment**. This philosophy is at the core of our AI companion's design. It doesn't just offer comfort; it provides users with the actionable intelligence and clear guidance needed to "wake up" from the confusion of an attack, regain control, and fight back against digital threats.

Ultimately, Project Zion is a fortress of support, designed to help users find their strength in the face of digital adversity.
